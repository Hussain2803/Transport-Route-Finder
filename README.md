# Transport Route Finder

## Overview
The **Transport Route Finder** is a Flask-based web application designed to help users find efficient bus routes between two locations. It supports direct routes, routes passing through specific areas, and routes with one or two transfer points.

## Features
- **Direct Route Finder**: Identify bus routes that connect two stops directly.
- **Area-Based Route Finder**: Discover routes passing through specific areas.
- **Routes with Transfers**: Find routes requiring one or two transfer points.
- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface for searching routes.

## Database Schema
### Tables Used:
1. **BusRoutes**:
   - `route_id`: Unique identifier for the route.
   - `route_name`: Name of the bus route.

2. **Stops**:
   - `stop_id`: Unique identifier for the stop.
   - `route_id`: Foreign key referencing `BusRoutes`.
   - `stop_name`: Name of the stop.
   - `stop_order`: Order of the stop on the route.

3. **BusAreas**:
   - `area_id`: Unique identifier for the area.
   - `route_id`: Foreign key referencing `BusRoutes`.
   - `area_name`: Name of the area.
   - `order_in_route`: Order of the area on the route.

4. **Connections**:
   - `connection_id`: Unique identifier for the connection.
   - `route_from`: The route where the transfer starts.
   - `route_to`: The route where the transfer ends.
   - `stop_name`: Name of the transfer stop.

## Application Routes
### `/`
- **Description**: Home page of the application.
- **Methods**: `GET`

### `/aboutus`
- **Description**: Information about the project or developers.
- **Methods**: `GET`

### `/search`
- **Description**: Route search page where users can input start and destination locations.
- **Methods**: `GET`, `POST`

## Usage
1. Navigate to the `/search` page.
2. Select your start and destination stops from the dropdown.
3. Click "Search" to view available routes.
4. Review the results for direct routes, area-based routes, and transfer-based routes.
